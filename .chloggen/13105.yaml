  The `receiverhelper`, `processorhelper`, and `scraperhelper` packages now record the number of bytes of items passed to and emitted from the receiver, processor, and scraper.

  - `receiver_accepted_spans_bytes`
  - `receiver_refused_spans_bytes`
  - `receiver_accepted_metric_points_bytes`
  - `receiver_refused_metric_points_bytes`
  - `receiver_accepted_log_records_bytes`
  - `receiver_refused_log_records_bytes`
  - `processor_incoming_items_bytes`
  - `processor_outgoing_items_bytes`

  Note this introduces a breaking change for those packages using the 
  `ObsReport` struct because the `EndTracesOp`, `EndMetricsOp`, and `EndLogsOp` methods now take an additional `numReceivedBytes` parameter.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
